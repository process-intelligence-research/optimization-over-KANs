This folder contains the training data (as csv file), the testing data (as csv file), and the corresponding scalers (as json file) for the four test functions considered in the paper listed below:
1. Peaks function
2. Rosenbrock function with 3 inputs (denoted as r3)
3. Rosenbrock function with 5 inputs (denoted as r5)
4. Rosenbrock function with 10 inputs (denoted as r10)

The scalers are provided for optimizing trained MLPs with [OMLT](https://github.com/cog-imperial/OMLT).
